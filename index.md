## MY PROJECTS
### DevStreams

>A live-stream curation platform that enables viewers to discover & categorize streams based on language, framework, and/or technology tags across Twitch, YouTube, Kick, & Beam.

- Built a series of services tasked with automated stream collection for app consumption & machine-learning model training.
- Implemented OAuth for Twitch, YouTube, Kick, Microsoft, & Google.
- Built a series of services for automatically tagging live-streams at ingress leveraging machine-learning/AI for gradually increasing accuracy & limited manual intervention.
- Built backend dashboard for handling content moderation as well as manual intervention of automated tagging.
- Used OCR (Optical Character Recognition) with TensorFlow models to identify programming languages & frameworks from video thumbnails containing code in view.
- Refactored the frontend codebase from VueJS to NextJS to take advantage of server-side rendering features.
- Implemented GraphQL alongside existing REST API to address over-fetching on creators’ profiles.
- Built out a robust performance & usage telemetry system to handle reactive scaling as well as respond to incidents & usage influx.
- Built a series of pipelines for CI/CD, automated testing, data aggregation, etc.
- Built a CLI tool using Python Fire for orchaestration of services & quick admin tasks. Later refactored this tool to GoLang to respond to environment concerns causing delays.
